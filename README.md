This repository compounds the basic work done under the subject Text mining in Social Media at Big Data Analytics Master Course (UPV)

The objective of the task is to predict variety and gender for a set of tweets written in spanish. Variety corresponds to the spanish language used in 7 different countries (Spain, México, Venezuela, Perú, Colombia, Argentina and Chile), while Gender, obviously, corresponds to the fact that the user is male or female. We have to build one or more jobs to predict both categories and for that we have some tools to work with.

Dataset: We've been provided with a dataset composed by 100 tweets for 2800 users as Train Data. We've also been provided with 100 tweets for 1400 users as Test Data.

We'll split the classification problem into 2 smaller problems and approaches, one for Variety classification (7 classes) and another for Gender classification (2 classes).

We have performed some data mining to the datasets: Part Of Speech-Tagging, Twitter specific features counting, and some other.
